* Preliminaries

** Homework

- Read chapter 2 of /Haskell programming from first principles/, covering basic Haskell syntax.
- To the end-of-chapter exercises.

** Lambda calculus summary

- The lambda calculus is a /formal system/ (i.e., a logic) for reasoning about /functions/.
- In the lambda calculus, computation is modelled as a form of simplification, using the following rules:
  * \(\beta \)-reduction.
    \((\lambda x . f(x))(y) \Rightarrow f(y)\)
  * \(\alpha \)-conversion.
    \(\lambda x . x \Rightarrow \lambda y . y\)
  * \(\eta\)-reduction.
    \(\lambda x . f(x) \Rightarrow f\)
- Haskell can be thought of as a kind of lambda calculi, where /running a program/ amounts to reducing a complex expression until we reach normal form.
- Reduction doesn't always converge on a normal form; sometimes expressions diverge; this corresponds to /non-terminating computations/ (imagine, for example, a program implementing a timer that runs indefinitely).

** Chapter 1 exercises, p18 n7 

\[(\lambda x y z . x z(yz))(\lambda x . z)(\lambda x . a)\]

1. Curry arguments: \(( \alert{\lambda x . \lambda y . \lambda z} . xz(yz) )(\lambda x . z)(\lambda x . a)\)
2. \(\alpha \)-conversion: \((\lambda x . \lambda y . \alert{\lambda z_1} . x\alert{z_1}(yz_1))(\lambda x . z)(\lambda x . a)\)
3. \(\beta \)-reduce: \((\lambda y . \lambda z_1 . (\alert{\lambda x.z})z_1(yz_1))(\lambda x . a )\)
4. \(\beta \)-reduce: \(\lambda z_1 . (\lambda x . z)z_1(\alert{(\lambda x . a)}z_1)\)
5. \(\beta \)-reduce:  \(\lambda z_1 . (\lambda x . z)z_1 \alert{a}\)
5. \(\beta \)-reduce:  \(\lambda z_1 . \alert{z} a\)
   
- Normal form!
  
* Getting started with Haskell
  
** Expressions and declarations

- Everything you write in Haskell is either an /expression/ or a /declaration/.
  * Expressions can be values, functions, functions applied to values, etc.
  * Declarations are bindings that allow us to name complex expressions.
    
Here are some examples of expressions in Haskell:

#+begin_src haskell
  1
  1 + 1
  "Icarus"
#+end_src

** The REPL

- The GHCi REPL stands for the /Glasgow Haskell Compiler interactive Read-Eval-Print-Loop/.
- It allows us to evaluation Haskell expressions directly without the need to save the program in a source file.
- There are a few different ways to get a GHCi instance:
  * In the browser: [[https://tryhaskell.org/]]
  * By installing GHC and running ~ghci~ in the terminal.

** REPL cont.

- When we type an expression into the REPL it automatically evaluates it for us. 
- The following expressions are already in normal form, so they simply evaluate to themselves.
  
#+begin_src haskell
  ghci> 1
  1
  ghci> "Icarus"
  "Icarus"
#+end_src

** A complication

- In reality, it's a bit more complex than that.
- An expression like ~1~ evaluates to an /integer/, but technically speaking integers aren't the kind of things that can be printed to an output, rather their /string representations/.
- Under the hood, GHCi exploits Haskell's type system to determine whether an expression is /showable/; what we see is given by the function associated with the showable type class.
  * We'll learn more about what this means later in the semester.

** Evaluating arithmetic expressions

- GHCi can be used as a basic calculator by inputting arithmetic expressions.
- Complex expressions are evaluated until we reach normal form:
  
#+begin_src haskell
  ghci> ((1 + 2) * 3) + 100
  109
#+end_src

- Note that GHCi doesn't show us any of the intermediate steps.
- N.b. expressions that can be reduced are called *redexes* (i.e., /reducible expressions/).

** Functions  

- /Functions/ in haskell are particular kinds of expressions, which play a very important role.
- Just like mathematical functions, they map inputs to outputs, in a determinate fashion.
- A Haskell function always evaluates to the same result when given the same argument values.
  * This property is known as /referential transparency/, and makes Haskell programs extremely straightforward to reason about.
  * For those of you with some experience programming in an imperative language like C, this is quite a departure! In imperative languages, evaluating a line of code might affect the state in a way which changes subsequent evaluations.

** Referential transparency

** More on functions

There are a number of different ways of declaring functions in haskell. Here is the simplest way:

#+begin_src haskell
  ghci> triple x = x * 3
  ghci> triple 4
  12
#+end_src

Function names always start with lower case letters in haskell. It's good practice to use descriptive function names, which conventionally use camel case, e.g.:

#+begin_src haskell
    ghci> multiplyByThree x = x * 3
    ghci> multiplyByThree 4
    12
#+end_src

** Abstractions

- Note that the equals sign ~=~ indicates that this is a /declaration/ rather than an expression.
- Note that declarations are much like abstractions, in the sense that the variable(s) to the left of the ~=~ bind the corresponding variable(s) to the right.
- In fact it's also possible to define functions directly as abstractions, using the following syntax:

#+begin_src haskell
  ghci> triple = \x -> x * 3
  ghci> triple 4
  12
  ghci> (\x -> x * 3) 4
  12 
#+end_src

** Call back

- Remember when I said that printing values in GHCi is more complicated than it first appears?
- Try evaluating an abstraction, e.g.,

#+begin_src haskell
  ghci> (\x -> x * 3)
#+end_src

** Intermission 

How would we declare a function that has one parameter and words for al the following expressions?

#+begin_src haskell
pi * (5 * 5)
pi * (10 * 10)
pi * (2 * 2)
pi * (4 * 4)
#+end_src

Note that ~pi~ is an expression that is given by the Haskell ~Prelude~. The prelude is a module (i.e., a set of declarations) that is implicitly imported by default.

** Solution

#+begin_src haskell
    ghci> circleArea radius = pi * (radius * radius)
    ghci> circleArea 5
    78.53981633974483
#+end_src

Note that as well descriptive function names, we can also use descriptive /variable/ names; there's no reason (aside from brevity) that we have to use single letters as variable names.

** Prefix vs. infix

As you've probably gathered, the syntax for /function application/ in Haskell just involves whitespace, i.e.., ~f x~ means \(f(x)\).

The arithmetic operators like ~+~ are /infix operators/; they can be used as ordinary functions by enclosing them in paretheses:

#+begin_src haskell
  ghci> 200 + 300
  500
  ghci> (+) 200 300
  500
  ghci> ((+) 200) 300
  500
#+end_src

** Declarations in the REPL

We can define functions and later use them with a single REPL session; the REPL has a limited form of state.

#+begin_src haskell
  ghci> y = 10
  ghci> x = 10 * 5 + y
  ghci> myResult = x * 5
  ghci> myResult
  300
#+end_src

You can quit the REPL by typing ~:q~; declarations won't persist between REPL sessions, so typing ~myResult~ in a new session will give you the following error:

#+begin_src 
  ghci> myResult
  error: Variable not in scope: myResult
#+end_src

** Declarations in source files

In order to get your declarations to persist, you need to write them into source files (called /modules/). Try saving the following as ~learn.hs~.

#+begin_src haskell
  module Learn where

  y = 10
  x = 10 * 5 + y
  myResult = x * 5
#+end_src

You can now /load/ the module in GHCi.

#+begin_src haskell
ghci> :l learn.hs
Ok, one module loaded.
ghci> myResult
300
#+end_src

** Tips for writing source files

A module must always start with a module declaration ~module MyModule where~; the module name should always start with a capital letter, unlike a function declaration.

White space and line-breaks are /significant/; the following won't compile; the second line should be indented:

#+begin_src haskell
x = 10 *
5 + y
#+end_src

Comments are lines starting with a double dash.

#+begin_src haskell
-- a random declaration serving no apparent purpose:
x = 10 * 5 + y
#+end_src

** More tips

Using a text editor with support for Haskell syntax highlighting will be a big help. Some options:

- VS Code.
  * Probably the most popular text editor right now, with excellent haskell support built in.
- Emacs (with ~haskell-mode~).
  * This is what I use. If you're not already familiar with emacs, I definitely wouldn't recommend it. 
- Notepad++
  * I don't really know anything about this, but apparently it's a good option if you're running Windows.

You can also just use the online Haskell playground, which has syntax highlighting baked in.    

** Basic arithmetic

Basic arithmetic can help us get a feel for how haskell expressions are evaluated, e.g., ~1 + 2 * 9 - 10~.

#+begin_export latex
\begin{forest}
  [{\texttt{9}}
  [{\texttt{19}}
    [{\texttt{1}}]
    [{\texttt{+}}]
    [{\texttt{18}}
      [{\texttt{2}}]
      [{\texttt{*}}]
      [{\texttt{9}}]
    ]
  ]
    [{\texttt{-}}]
    [{\texttt{10}}]
  ]
\end{forest}
#+end_export

** Associativity and precedence

Arithmetic infix operators in haskell:

- ~+~ : addition
- ~-~: subtraction
- ~*~: multiplication
- ~/~: fractional division
  
You can get information about operator /associativity/ and /precedence/ using the ~:info~ command in GHCi.

#+begin_src haskell
  ghci> :i (+)
  infixl 6 +
#+end_src

N.b. this will also give you information about the /type/ of the expression. This won't be relevant yet, but will be important soon.

** The ~$~ operator

This ~$~ is an important infix operator that is often used to write terse haskell code without parentheses. Here is its definition:

#+begin_src haskell
  f $ a = f a
#+end_src

This is an ~infixr~ operator with the lowest possible precedence:

#+begin_src haskell
  (2^) $ 2 + 2
  (2^) (2 + 2)
#+end_src

** ~let~ and ~where~

- ~let~ is used to introduce an expression.
- ~where~ is a /declaration/ that is bound in its containing syntactic construct.
  
#+begin_src haskell
  printInc n = print plusTwo
    where plusTwo = n + 2
#+end_src

#+begin_src haskell
  printInc n = let plusTwo = n + 2
		 in print plusTwo
#+end_src

** Intermission

#+begin_src haskell
  z = 7
  x = y ^ 2
  waxOn = x * 5
  y = z + 8
#+end_src

Write out what will happen when you run the following:

- ~10 + waxOn~
- ~(+ 10) waxOn~
- ~(-) 15 waxOn~
- ~(-) waxOn 15~
